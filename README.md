# FindAuthor
This repository contains a set of projects designed to identify and analyze authors based on textual content. Whether you're interested in learning more about a specific author, parsing documents, or making educated guesses about the authorship of a text, this repository has you covered.

Projects:

Author

The Author project provides a comprehensive description of any author, showcasing various statistics and details that help paint a picture of their writing style and patterns.

Document

The Document project introduces a powerful Document object that takes charge of scanning and parsing textual documents. This object encapsulates all the sentences found in a document, setting the stage for detailed analysis.

FindAuthor

The FindAuthor project takes center stage in author identification. Given a file as input, this project leverages sophisticated algorithms to make an educated guess about who the author might be. It's the detective of the repository!

Phrase

The Phrase project focuses on creating and managing Phrase objects. These objects consist of groups of Token objects, each containing a single word. The granularity at the phrase level helps in more nuanced analysis.

Scanner

The Scanner project is the engine behind the scenes. Responsible for reading input streams character by character, it diligently separates the input into meaningful tokens. This is a crucial step in the overall process of understanding and analyzing text.

Sentence

The Sentence project brings together groups of Phrase objects to form cohesive sentences. This higher-level structure facilitates a more contextual understanding of the text, enabling deeper analysis.

Token

The Token project defines the smallest units of analysis. Tokens include words, end-of-sentence delimiters, end-of-file markers, phrase separators, digits, and other characters. This project lays the groundwork for understanding the intricacies of the language.
